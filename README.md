## Tube Distortion

A basic .vst3 plugin that's create for mixing guitars and vocals. 

## Usage

The tube distortion emulation comes mainly from controlling the odd and even harmonics, 
with the drive knob being a soft clipper. The output knob is a hard clipper, so prefer 
keeping your output lower (less than 50%) in most cases. The order sets an exponential 
boost to the odd and harmonics, allowing you to experiment with different tones.

## WIP

- Updated interface for a more modern look, with images
- Balancing algorithm to mitigate stereo offset with the even harmonics
- Smoother, responsive color change visualization on transients
